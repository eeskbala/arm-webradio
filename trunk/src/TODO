Current issues:
---------------

- Rotary encoder does the wrong thing the first time used after system startup
  - solutionn could be to wait at least two events to get the correct direction

- support more SD card vendors and their capacities
  - SanDisk 512 MiB SD [works]
  - Kingston 2 GiB [fails to detect]

- MAC address modification in the web interface is broken

Wishlist:
---------

- password protection in the web interface
- playing all songs available on the SD card
- displaying interpret and song title for webradio and SD card
- moving forward/backward in songs from the SD card and also skipping songs
- add a macro to change rotary encoder's direction (currently for the V3
  PCB it interacts in a non intuitive manner)

Doc wishlist:
-------------

- how to use (play) the network shares
